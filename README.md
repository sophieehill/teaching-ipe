# International Political Economy - Section Materials

- This repo contains section slides (created in collaboration with the wonderful [Chelsea Green](https://gov.harvard.edu/people/chelsea-green)) for Gov 1780: International Political Economy, an undergraduate class taught at Harvard by [Professor Jeffry Frieden](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jfrieden/home) in Spring 2021
- This course was taught online due to COVID, and as a result we experimented with lots of different types of "activities" to keep students engaged during section
- Slides are available in both `.pdf` and `.pptx` format
- Feel free to use and adapt for your own teaching!
